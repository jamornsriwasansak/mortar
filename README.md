# Mortar - A fast (enough) physically based renderer

Mortar is a small physically based renderer with agnostic api.
It can use either Vulkan or DX12 as a backend.
For now, it was intended for offline usage but seems fast enough for real-time as well.

> Note: These images are generated by vulkan path tracing code that is now [deprecated](https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/tree/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src).

### Note
Recently, I deprecated the old Vulkan backend and replaced with a new backend that supports both Vulkan and DX12.
Many features are therefore also deprecated.
Please do not clone the code as it will be editted daily.

### Input
At this moment, the application accepts OBJ format for loading models and HDR format for environment map.
It guesses the ggx parameters from MTL file provided along with OBJ.
Roughness values are mapped from specular exponents (Ns values) using Blinn-Phong to microfacet mapping mentioned in [Brian Karis' blog](http://graphicrants.blogspot.com/2013/08/specular-brdf-reference.html).

As I do not have much time at this moment, changing the scene requires you to modify the code by yourself.
An example is in "src/mainloop.cpp"

### Features
In its current early stage, it supports:
* Ambient occlusion Integrator ([link to deprecated code](https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/blob/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src/shaders/renderer/rtao/rtao.rgen))
* Path tracer with next event estimation utilizing MIS [Veach's thesis](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis) \[1997] ([link to deprecated code](https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/blob/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src/shaders/renderer/pathtracer/pathtracer.rgen))
* Environment map importance sampling  ([link to deprecated code] (https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/blob/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src/common/envmap.h))
* Alpha-testing
* GPU-based Low discreprancy sampler with blue-noise property ported from [Heitz et al.](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/762-2/) \[2019]  ([link to deprecated code] (https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/blob/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src/shaders/rng/bluesobol.glsl))
* GPU-based PCG random number generator ported from [pcg-random.org](https://www.pcg-random.org/)
* Lambert diffuse BRDF
* GGX Microfacet BSDF (rough conductor and rough dielectric) ([link to deprecated code](https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/mortar/blob/master/deprecated-vk-pt-src/shaders/common/bsdf.glsl))
* FPS-style camera for traversing the scene

I plan to add Spatiotemporal reservoir resampling for direct light soon.
